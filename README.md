## Getting started

> The getting started guide is currently unsupported, due to the recent Now v2 changes.
> Stay tuned for updates on how to get started.

Starting an instance special tailored for you is not that hard.
It's done by running a single CLI/[Now](https://now.sh) command!

```bash
$ now ItsWendell/my-spotify-charts
```

This command will ask for your GitHub username and will build the project automatically.
It might take a couple of minutes before everything is deployed and ready for use.
In case you want to automate the deployments, you can define the username in the command itself.

```bash
$ now ItsWendell/my-spotify-charts --build-env GITHUB_USERNAME=byCedric
```
